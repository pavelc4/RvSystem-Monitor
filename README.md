# RvSystem Monitor

RvSystem Monitor is a powerful, high-performance Android system monitoring application built with **Jetpack Compose** and a **Rust** backend. It provides real-time insights into your device's hardware, processor performance, and memory usage.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Detailed CPU Monitoring**: Real-time per-core frequencies (Current, Min, Max) and scaling governors.
- **Memory Insights**: Live tracking of RAM and ZRAM usage with precise GB and percentage metrics.
- **Hardware Overview**: Comprehensive information about SOC Manufacturer, Model, OS Version, and GPU (Vendor/Renderer).
- **Performance Optimized**: Native Rust backend for efficient system file parsing with minimal JVM overhead.
- **Lifecycle Aware**: Intelligent data streaming that automatically stops when the app is in the background to save battery.
- **Modern UI**: Clean, expressive Material 3 design with animated progress indicators and responsive layouts.

## 🛠️ Architecture

The project follows a modern, modular architecture:

- **Frontend (Kotlin/Compose)**: 
  - Uses **Clean Architecture** patterns with Domain, Data, and UI layers.
  - **Dagger Hilt** for dependency injection.
  - **StateFlow** and **Coroutines** for reactive, lifecycle-aware data handling.
- **Backend (Rust)**:
  - Mirroring **Linux Kernel** organization (`kernel/`, `mm/`).
  - High-performance sysfs and procfs parsing.
  - Interfaced via **JNI (Java Native Interface)** for maximum efficiency.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1.  **Android Studio** (Ladybug or newer recommended).
2.  **Rust Toolchain**: Install via [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).
3.  **Android NDK**: Required for Rust compilation.
4.  **cargo-ndk**: `cargo install cargo-ndk`.

### Building the Project

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Rve27/RvSystem-Monitor.git
    cd RvSystem-Monitor
    ```

2.  **Build Rust Libraries**:
    The project is configured to build Rust libraries automatically during the Gradle build process. You can also trigger it manually:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew :app:buildRustLibraries
    ```

3.  **Build and Run**:
    - **Using Android Studio**: Open the project in Android Studio and click **Run**.
    - **Using CLI**:
        - **Build Debug APK**:
          ```bash
          ./gradlew assembleDebug
          ```
        - **Build Release APK**:
          ```bash
          ./gradlew assembleRelease
          ```
        - **Install and Run on Device**:
          ```bash
          ./gradlew installDebug
          ```

          The APK will be located at `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

## 📝 Debugging

The application includes detailed lifecycle logging in `debug` variants. You can monitor the status of CPU and Memory data streams in **Logcat** by filtering for the `SystemInfoRepository` tag.
