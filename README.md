## ✨ Key Features

| Category | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🔋 Battery Intelligence** | Live tracking of Wattage (W), cycle counts (Android 14+), health percentage, and precise Deep Sleep vs. Uptime metrics. |
| **🖥️ System Overlay** | A draggable, low-overhead floating monitor for real-time FPS and RAM metrics. Fully customizable update intervals. |
| **⚙️ CPU Dynamics** | Detailed per-core monitoring including current, minimum, and maximum frequencies and scaling governors. |
| **🧠 Memory & ZRAM** | High-precision tracking of RAM and ZRAM usage, including cached, buffers, and kernel slab memory. |
| **⚡ Native Performance** | Optimized Rust backend that parses kernel files (`/proc`, `/sys`) directly with efficient JNI batching. |
| **🎨 Expressive UI** | Built with Material 3 Expressive, featuring adaptive layouts and sophisticated screen transitions. |

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project adheres to **Clean Architecture** principles, ensuring a strict separation of concerns and high maintainability.

### The Hybrid Core
- **Frontend (Kotlin)**: Orchestrates UI state using **Dagger Hilt** for DI and **Coroutines/StateFlow** for reactive data streams. It features a custom `ScreenWrapper` for advanced visual effects.
- **Backend (Rust)**: Handles heavy lifting and system parsing. It mirrors the Linux kernel's structure (`kernel/` for CPU, `mm/` for Memory) to provide an idiomatic and high-performance data source.
- **JNI Bridge**: A custom-built bridge optimized for **batch data retrieval**, minimizing the costly context switching between the JVM and Native code.
